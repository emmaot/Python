## Installation
This program requires python3 (and likely `pip3` to install modules). On Ubuntu 18.04 this can be installed with
```
$ sudo apt install python3 python3-pip
```
The modules "pandas", "seaborn", "numpy", and "matplotlib" are also required.
```
$ pip3 install pandas seaborn matplotlib
```
